Bush league is an app for recreational sports teams to manage their league, team and players. It was designed first for hockey leagues, but the architecture of the app will allow for expansion into other sports down the line. Recreational sports need an app that will help with scheduling, stat tracking, payments to refs and team leaders, and just overall communication.
